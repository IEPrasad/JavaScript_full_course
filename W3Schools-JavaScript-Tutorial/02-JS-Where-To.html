JavaScript Where To

<!--1- The <script> Tag -->

  ** In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

Example 
  <script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
  </script>

<!-- 
  ** Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/  javascript">.
  ** The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML. 
-->

2- JavaScript Functions and Events
  
  ** A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

  ** For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user  clicks a button.

** You will learn much more about functions and events in later chapters.

3- JavaScript in <head> or <body>

  ** You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
  
  ** Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
  

4- JavaScript in <head>
  ** In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.
  
  ** The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:


Example 
  
<head>
  <script>
    function myFunction() {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph Changed.";
    }
  </script>
</head>

<body>
  <h2>Demo JavaScript in Head</h2>

  <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
  <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
</body>

---

<!-- 5- JavaScript in <body> -->

  ** In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <body></body> section of and HTML page.
  ** The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:

Example

  <body>

  <h2>Demo JavaScript in Body</h2>
  
  <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
  
  <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
  
  <script>
  function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
  }
  </script>
  
  </body>

---

  ** Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body></body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.


6- External JavaScript

  ** Scripts can also be placed in external files:

  External file: myScript.js

    function myFunction() {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
    }
---

    External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

    JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
    
    <!-- To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag: -->

Example      
  <script src="myScript.js"></script>
<!-- 
** You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

** The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located. 
-->

<!-- ** External scripts cannot contain <script> tags. -->

  ** External JavaScript Advantages
    Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

    It separates HTML and code
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
    To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:

Example
  <script src="myScript1.js"></script>
  <script src="myScript2.js"></script>


  External References
  An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:
  
  With a full URL (a full web address)
  With a file path (like /js/)
  Without any path
  This example uses a full URL to link to myScript.js:

Example
  <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>

  This example uses a file path to link to myScript.js:

Example
  <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>

  This example uses no path to link to myScript.js:

Example
  <script src="myScript.js"></script>


  You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths.
