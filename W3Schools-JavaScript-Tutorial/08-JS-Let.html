JavaScript Let 

  ** The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015) >> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp

  ** Variables declared with let have Block Scope 

  ** Variables declared with let must be Declared before Use

  *** Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope


Block Scope 

  ** Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope. 
  ** JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.
  ** ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
  ** These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

Example 
  ** Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

  {
    let x = 2;
  }

  // x can NOT be used here

---

Global Scope 

  ** Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.
  ** Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:
  
  
Example 
  ** Variables declared with var inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:

  {
    var x = 2;
  }

  // x CAN be used here

---

Cannot be Redeclared

  ** Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.
  ** You can not accidentally redeclare a variable with let.

  * With let you not do this:

    let x = "John Doe";

    let x = 0;

  ---

  ** Variables defined with var can be redeclared.

  * With var you can do this:

    var x = "John Doe";

    var x = 0;

Redeclaring Variables 

  ** Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.
  ** Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:

Example 

  var x = 10;
  // Here x is 10

  {
    var x = 2;
    // Here x is 2
  }

  // Here x is 2

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head></head>
<body>
  <h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using var</h2>

  <p id="demo"></p>

  <script>
    var x = 10;
    // Here x is 10

  {
    var x = 2;
    // Here x is 2
  }

  // Here x is 2
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
  </script>
</body>
</html>

Difference Between var, let and const 


        Scope	    Redeclare	  Reassign	  Hoisted	  Binds this
var	    No	      Yes	        Yes	        Yes	      Yes
let	    Yes     	No        	Yes       	No      	No
const	  Yes     	No        	No        	No      	No

What is Good?
  ** let and const have block scope.
  ** let and const can not be redeclared.
  ** let and const must be declared before use.
  ** let and const does not bind to this.
  ** let and const are not hoisted.

What is Not Good?
  ** var does not have to be declared.
  ** var is hoisted.
  ** var binds to this.

Browser Support
  ** The let and const keywords are not supported in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier.

Redeclaring 

  ** Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a program:

Example 

  var x = 2;
  // Now x is 2

  var x = 3;
  // Now x is 3

  ** With let, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed:

Example 

  <script>
    var x = 2;    // Allowed
    let x = 3;    // Not allowed 

    {
      let x = 2;  // Allowed 
      let x = 3;  // Not allowed 
    }

    {
      let x = 2;  // Allowed 
      var x = 3;  // Not allowed
    }
  </script>

  ** Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed:

Example 
  <script>
    let x = 2;    // Allowed 
    
    {
      let x = 3;  // Allowed
    }

    {
      let x = 4;  // Allowed
    }
  </script>


Let Hoisting 

  ** Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top can be initialized at any time.

  ** Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:

Example

  ** This is OK:

  <script>
    carName = "Volvo";
    var carName;
  </script>


  
** If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.

** Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

** Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:

Example
  carName = "Saab";
  let carName = "Volvo";
