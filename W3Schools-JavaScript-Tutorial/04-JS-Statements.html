JavaScript Statements

Example

  let x, y, z;    // Statement 1
  x = 5;          // Statement 2
  y = 6;          // Statement 3
  z = x + y;      // Statement 4

JavaScript Programs 

  ** A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

  ** In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

  ** A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.


** In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

JavaScript Statements

  - JavaScript statements are composed of:

  - Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

  - statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";

---

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

** JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

Examples 

  let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
  a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
  b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
  c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c

** When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:

** On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
** Ending statements with semicolons is not required, but highly recommended.

JavaScript White Space

  ** JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

  ** The following lines are equivalent:

let person = "Hege";
let person="Hege";

** A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

let x = y + z;

---

JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

  ** For best readability, programmers often like to avoid to code lines longer than 80 characters.

  ** If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

Example 

  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";

---

JavaScript Code Blocks

  ** JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

  ** The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

  ** One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions: 

Example

  function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
  }

** In this tutorial we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks. 
** You will learn more about functions later in this tutorial.

JavaScript Keywords

  ** JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

  ** Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.
    >> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp

  ** Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:


  Keyword	            Description
  
  var	            	Declares a variable
  let		            Declares a block variable
  const	            Declares a block constant
  if		            Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
  switch	          Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
  for		            Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
  function	        Declares a function
  return		        Exits a function
  try		            Implements error handling to a block of statements


** JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
