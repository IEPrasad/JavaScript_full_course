JavaScript Variables 

  * Variables are Containers for Storing Data
  * JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

      Automatically
      Using var
      Using let
      Using const

  ** In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.

  ** They are automatically declared when first used:

  x = 5;
  y = 6;
  z = x + y;

Note
  ** It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.


  ** From the examples you can guess:

    x stores the value 5
    y stores the value 6
    z stores the value 11

Example using var

  var x = 5;
  var y = 6;
  var z = x + y;

Note
  ** The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

  ** The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
  
  ** The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

  Example using let
    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;
    let z = x + y;

  Example using const
    const x = 5;
    const y = 6;
    const z = x + y;

  Mixed Example
    const price1 = 5;
    const price2 = 6;
    let total = price1 + price2;

  ** The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.

    * These are constant values and cannot be changed.
  
    * The variable total is declared with the let keyword.
  
    * The value total can be changed.

When to Use var, let, or const?
  1. Always declare variables

  2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

  3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

  4. Only use let if you can't use const

  5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

Just Like Algebra
  ** Just like in algebra, variables hold values:  

    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;

Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions:

  ** let z = x + y;

** From the example above, you can guess that the total is calculated to be 11.


Note
  Variables are containers for storing values.

JavaScript Identifiers

  ** All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
  ** These unique names are called identifiers.
  ** Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

  ** The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must begin with a letter.
    Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
    Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
    Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

---

Note  
  JavaScript Identifiers are case-sensitive.

---

** The Assignment Operator 

  ** In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

  This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:

    x = x + 5


    In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

      ** (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)

---

Note
  The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

JavaScript Data Types

  JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

  In programming, text values are called text strings.

  JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

  Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

  If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.



Example 

  const pi = 3.14;
  let person = "John Doe";
  let answer = 'Yes I am!';

Declaring a JavaScript Variable 

  ** Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
  ** You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:

  var carName;

  or:

  let carName;


  After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).

  To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
  
  carName = "Volvo";  

  You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:

  let carName = "Volvo";

  ** In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it.

  ** Then we "output" the value inside an HTML paragraph with id="demo":

Example

  <body>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      let carName = "Volvo";
      document.getElementById.innerHTML = carName;
    </script>
  </body>

Note
  It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

---

One Statement, Many Variables

  ** You can declare many variables in one statement.

  ** Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:

  let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

  A declaration can span multiple lines:

  Example 
    let person = "John Doe",
    carName = "Volvo",
    price = 200;

---

Value = undefined 

  ** In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.

  ** A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined

Example 

  let carName;

---

Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables
  
  ** If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.

  ** The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

Example

  var carName = "Volvo";
  var carName;

Note 
  You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
  This will not work:

  let carName = "Volvo";
  let carName;

---

JavaScript Arithmetic 

  ** As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables , using operators like = and +:

  Example 
    let x  = 5 + 2 + 3;


** You can also add strings will be concatenated:

Example
  let x = "John" + " " + "Doe";

Example
  let x = "5" + 2 + 3;

Note
  If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.

---

JavaScript Dollar Sign $
  
  ** Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:

Example

  let $ = "Hello World";
  let $$$ = 2;
  let $myMoney = 5;


  ** Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

  ** In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".

--- 

JavaScript Underscore (_)
  
  ** Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:

Example 

  let _lastName = "Johnson";
  let _x = 2;
  let _100 = 5;


** Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.
