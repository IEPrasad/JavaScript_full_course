<!-- 

(1) What is an object?
    An object groups 
    multiple values together

    const product = {};
  ^^^ this is called an object ^^^


  Syntax Rules for Objects

    ** we start with an curly bracket and end with a closed curly bracket 
    name and price we called property

    we seperate the property and value with a colon
    and (name = 'socks') this is called 
    Property-Value Pair

    We can have many property value in an object and
    we separate them with a comma.

    product.name >> this is called Dot Notation.

 --> 
 <!-- Why we use objects
      - make our code more org anized
Objects 
    - let us group multiple values together
    - let us use multiple values together
    
visit : supersimple.dev/projects/objects
    
-->

<!-- 
  More details about Objects 

    remind: 
        product.name -- this is called Dot Notation
    
    **we going to learn about objects is another  
      way to access the values inside. we previously learn the Dot Notation.

    console.log(product2['name']);
        ^^^ this is called Bracket Notation ^^^

  ** Bracket Notation
      -- lets us use properties that don't work
         with dot notation

      -- another feature of bracket notation
         we don't just have to use a string, we can 
         use a variable, calculation or anything that result in a value.
          product2[variable1]
          product2['delevery' + 'time']
    

  *** Which one should we use?
      - use dot notation by default 
      - for properties that don't work,
        use bracket notation
        
  . Iside an object, we can save any type of value
      numbers, strings, booleans as well as other objects

  . We also can add the functions inside the objects
      -- A funtion is another type of value
    ** 
      Funtion inside object 
      = Method
  console.log(typeof console) >> object
  console.log(typeof console.log) >> function
    ^^ so this is also a Method 

  Math.random()
  Math is object
  random() is funtion
  so this is also a Method
  object + function = method
-->

<!-- ----- Now we are going to learn Built-in Objects 

  (they are provided by the language)
  
2 More Built-in Objects

  JSON
  localStorage

JSON Built-in Obeject
  - helps us work with JSON
  JavaScript Object Notation
  - a syntax
  - similar to JavaScript object
  - but has less features


---------- Java Script Object ----------
{
  name: 'shirt',
  'delivery-time' : '1 day',
  rating: {
    stars: 4.5,
    count: 87
  },
  funt: function funtion1 () {
    console.log('funtion inside object')
  }
}
-------------------------------------------
---------- JSON ---------------------------
{
  "name" : "shirt",
  "delivery-time": "1 day",
  "rating": {
    "stars": 4.5,
    "count": 87
  }

}

must use double quotes in JSON
JSON does not support single quotes
and JSON does not support functions 


--- So why would we use JSON Syntax
instead of a JavaScript object syntax?

  . A JavaScript object only makes sense in JavaScript
  . Jason Syntax can be understood by almost every programming language.
  . So JASON is more universal

  We use JASON
    - when we send data between computers
    - when we store data

  Buit-in JSON Object
  Convert:
  JavaScript Object >to> JSON

  JSON.stringify(product2)
  this will convert the object into JSON
  
  So one thing to note about stringify
  is that actually results in a string.

  we can do this in another way 
  JSON back to a JavaScript.
  Convert: 
    JSON >to> JavaScript
    JSON.parse()

<!-- -------------
  
  Next built-in object:
  localStorage

  - save values more permenetly

  ** varianles are temporary
  ** if we refresh / close the page,
     all the variables are deleted 

    we go to our rock paper scissors code 

    localStorage is only support the strings.
    localStorage.setItem('message', 'hello');
    message is name and hello is value in here.

    get the value out of the localStorage 
    localStorage.getItem('name'); >>
    ex: console.log(localStorage.getItem('message'));
