<!-- 

(1) What is an object?
    An object groups 
    multiple values together

    const product = {};
  ^^^ this is called an object ^^^


  Syntax Rules for Objects

    ** we start with an curly bracket and end with a closed curly bracket 
    name and price we called property

    we seperate the property and value with a colon
    and (name = 'socks') this is called 
    Property-Value Pair

    We can have many property value in an object and
    we separate them with a comma.

    product.name >> this is called Dot Notation.

 --> 
 <!-- Why we use objects
      - make our code more org anized
Objects 
    - let us group multiple values together
    - let us use multiple values together
    
visit : supersimple.dev/projects/objects
    
-->

<!-- 
  More details about Objects 

    remind: 
        product.name -- this is called Dot Notation
    
    **we going to learn about objects is another  
      way to access the values inside. we previously learn the Dot Notation.

    console.log(product2['name']);
        ^^^ this is called Bracket Notation ^^^

  ** Bracket Notation
      -- lets us use properties that don't work
         with dot notation

      -- another feature of bracket notation
         we don't just have to use a string, we can 
         use a variable, calculation or anything that result in a value.
          product2[variable1]
          product2['delevery' + 'time']
    

  *** Which one should we use?
      - use dot notation by default 
      - for properties that don't work,
        use bracket notation
        
  . Iside an object, we can save any type of value
      numbers, strings, booleans as well as other objects

  . We also can add the functions inside the objects
      -- A funtion is another type of value
    ** 
      Funtion inside object 
      = Method
  console.log(typeof console) >> object
  console.log(typeof console.log) >> function
    ^^ so this is also a Method 

  Math.random()
  Math is object
  random() is funtion
  so this is also a Method
  object + function = method
-->

<!-- ----- Now we are going to learn Built-in Objects 

  (they are provided by the language)
  
2 More Built-in Objects

  JSON
  localStorage

JSON Built-in Obeject
  - helps us work with JSON
  JavaScript Object Notation
  - a syntax
  - similar to JavaScript object
  - but has less features


---------- Java Script Object ----------
{
  name: 'shirt',
  'delivery-time' : '1 day',
  rating: {
    stars: 4.5,
    count: 87
  },
  funt: function funtion1 () {
    console.log('funtion inside object')
  }
}
-------------------------------------------
---------- JSON ---------------------------
{
  "name" : "shirt",
  "delivery-time": "1 day",
  "rating": {
    "stars": 4.5,
    "count": 87
  }

}

must use double quotes in JSON
JSON does not support single quotes
and JSON does not support functions 


--- So why should we use JSON Syntax
instead of a JavaScript object syntax?

  . A JavaScript object only makes sense in JavaScript
  . Jason Syntax can be understood by almost every programming language.
  . So JASON is more universal

  We use JASON
    - when we send data between computers
    - when we store data

  Buit-in JSON Object
  Convert:
  JavaScript Object >to> JSON

  JSON.stringify(product2)
  this will convert the object into JSON
  
  So one thing to note about stringify
  is that actually results in a string.

  we can do this in another way 
  JSON back to a JavaScript.
  Convert: 
    JSON >to> JavaScript
    JSON.parse()

<!-- -------------
  
  Next built-in object:
  localStorage

  - save values more permenetly

  ** variables are temporary
  ** if we refresh / close the page,
     all the variables are deleted 

    we go to our rock paper scissors code 

    localStorage is only support the strings.*****
    localStorage.setItem('message', 'hello');
    message is name and hello is value in here.

    get the value out of the localStorage 
    localStorage.getItem('name'); >>
    ex: console.log(localStorage.getItem('message'));
  
------------- -->


<!--
   ----------- Auto-Boxing -----------
  
-->

<!-- 
  Objects are references

    console.log(object3 === object1); // >> false
  It will tell us that these two 
  objects are not equal to each other 
  even though they have these same values inside.
  And that's because remember 'Objects are References'

  and this code compares the references 
      and not the values inside the object.......

      but 
      console.log(object2 === object1); // >> true
  *** these two variables have the same reference.


 -->
 <!-- 
  ** We can't compare objects directly
  ** because objects are references.
-->


<!-- ------- short cuts for the objects ---------

    const obeject4 = {
      message: 'Good job!'
    };
    // const message = obeject4.message; // a
    const { message } = obeject4;     // b
      // there is a and b same and b is the short cut for the a. this is called "destructuring"
    console.log(message);
    
    ----- ^^ 
        this will take the message property out of  
        object4 and save it in a variable called 
        message.

    Next we can use this destructuring shortcut for multiple properties.
  
        destructuring
          - easier way to take properties
            out of an object
 
--------- Shorthand Property

    const object5 = {
      message: message
    };
----------- ^^ this is same for the 
      we can use the message instead message: message
      this is called Shorthand Property
      we can use this like this
    
    const object5 = {
      message
    };

    console.log(object5); // >> Good job!


---------------------- 
the last shortcut we going to learn 

    Shorthand Method --------
      method: function function1 () {
        console.log('method');
      }
    vvvv---- this is doing same thing --vvv

      method() {
        console.log('method');
      }

<!-- ------------- All things about the localStorage --------- 

    ** 'localStorage' is a web storage feature in modern web browsers that allows you
       to store key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration time. The data 
       stored in 'localStorage' persists even when the browser is closed and reopend. 
       It provides a simple way to store and retrieve data on the client side, making 
       it useful for scenarios such as caching, preferences, and user settings.

       Here's a basic overview of how to use 'localStorage' in JavaScript:

       Storing Data in localStorage: ********

       ** You can store data using the 'localStorage.setItem()' method. The data is 
          stored as a key-value pair.

          // Store data in localStorage
          localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
          localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');

       Rerieving Data from localStorage: ********
        ** You can retrieve data using the 'localStorage.getItem()' method.

          // Retrieve data from localStorage
          const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
          const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');

          console.log(username); // Output: JohnDoe
          console.log(theme); // Output: dark

       Removing Data from localStorage: ********

        ** You can remove data using the 'localStorage.removeItem()' method.

          // Remove data from localStorage
          localStorage.removeItem('username');

       Clearing All Data from localStorage:

        ** To remove all data stored in 'localStorage', you can use the
           'localStorage.clear()' method.

          // Clear all data from localStorage
          localStorage.clear();

         Important Considerations: 

            >> 'localStorage' has a size limit (usually around 5MB per domain), so be mindful
                of the amount of data you store.

            >> Data stored in 'localStorage' is accessible only on the same domain and
               protocol (http/https) from which it was stored.

            >> The data in 'localStorage' persists across browser sessions and tabs.

            Example use case: 
              
              // Check if a user's theme preference is stored, and set the theme accordingly
              const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');

              if (savedTheme) {
                // Apply the saved theme
                document.body.classList.add(savedTheme);
              } else {
                // Set a default theme
                localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light');
                document.body.classList.add('light');
              }
          
          ** Keep in mind that while 'localStorage' is convenient for certain scenarios, it's not 
             suitable for storing sensitive information due to its accessibility on the client side.
             For secure and sensitive data, consider using other storage options like HTTP
             cookies with proper security measures or server-side storage.
