<!-- 

(1) What is an object?
    An object groups 
    multiple values together

    const product = {};
  ^^^ this is called an object ^^^


  Syntax Rules for Objects

    ** we start with an curly bracket and end with a closed curly bracket 
    name and price we called property

    we seperate the property and value with a colon
    and (name = 'socks') this is called 
    Property-Value Pair

    We can have many property value in an object and
    we separate them with a comma.

    product.name >> this is called Dot Notation.

 <!-- Why we use objects

- make our code more organized-->
