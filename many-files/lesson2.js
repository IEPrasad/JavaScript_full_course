--------- In programming 
    
      2,3,4 = integers
      2.2, 2.5 = floating point numbers (floats)


  ** Computers have a problem working with floats.
      
      Human       Computer
        2            10
        99         1100011
        0.2          ???       

** When calculating money,
   we want to avoid any inaccuracies.

   using console we have to seen this problem
   20.95 + 7.99
   >> 28.93999999999998

   How do we avoid this problem?
   = calculate in cents instead of dollars

   (2095 + 799) / 100
   = 28.94

      (*Calcutations with floats are sometimes inaccurate*)

      When working with money 

      1. Do the calculation in cents

How to round a number 

2.2 --------->> 2

Math.round(2.2)
2

Math.round(2.8)
3
-------- 

((2095 + 799) * 0.1) / 100
>> 2.894

Math.round((2095 + 799) * 0.1) / 100
>> 2.89
