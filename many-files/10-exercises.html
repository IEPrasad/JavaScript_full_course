  Lesson 10 Exercises- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Together

  ** Create the following buttons using HTML and CSS. The Styles don't have 
    to be exact (just use your best judgment).

  10a. Amazon button   
      (   Add to cart  )
      rgb(255, 216, 20)

  10b. Uber buttons
      [  Request now  ]  [  Schedule for later  ]
                          rgb(230, 230, 230)

  10c. classList has another method, classList.contains('class-name'),
    which checks if an element has a class.
        . Create a button: <button class="js-button">Test</button>
        . Use document.querySelector() and classList.contains('js-button')
          to check if this button has the class 'js-button'.
        . cosole.log() the result.

  10d. Create the button on the right. When clicking 
      this button, it should turn ON/ OFF. Hints:
        . When clicking the button, add or remove the 
        class 'is-toggled', and use it to change the styling.
        . Use if (classList.contains('is-toggled')) to decide
          whether to add or remove the 'is-toggled' class.

  10h. Create a file 10h.html and copy the code from 10-dom-projects.html.
      In the Amazon Shipping Calculator, if we type a number less than 0,
      display a red error message below the text box:

      -------------------- -------------
      | -5               | | Calculate |
      -------------------- -------------
      Error: cost cannot be less than $0



  10i. We'll style the calculator project using CSS.
        . Make a copy of exercise 9j. 
        . In your browser, go to:
          supersimple.dev/projects/calculator-final
          This is the final design for the project to 
          look like the final design on the right.

  10j. Continuning from exercise 10i, separate each language
      into its own file (if you didn't do this already).
