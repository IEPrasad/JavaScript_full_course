HTML = creates the content 
CSS = changes the appearance

HTML - giving instructions to a computer

    we can add a tooltip for the HTML 
    <button title='this is tooltip'>
        subscribe
    </button>

the title is called attribute. 'this is tooltip' called attribute value.

</script>


Console = try out JavaScript code 

example:
<button title='hello' onclick="
alert('Good job!')"> 
hello
</button>
