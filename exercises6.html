
          Lesson 6 Exercises - Booleans ad If-Statements

(Note: to do these exercises, create an HTML file (like 6a.html, 6b.html, ...))

6a. Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day (use 
24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23). 
  . If hour is between 6 and 12, display   'Good morning!' in the console
  . If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console
  . Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console

6b. Continuning from 6a, try changing the value in the 'hour' variable to make it display different messages.

6c. Continuning from 6a, create a variable called 'name' and save your name inside (as string).
    Update the if-statement to display your name in each message.
    For example: 'Good morning ${name}!' 



6d. Imagine an amusemnet park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
    . Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.
    . Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. if they do, display 'Discount' in the console.
      Otherwise 'No dicount' in the console.
      Note: try use the || operator in your solution.
    . Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages.
    
6e. Continuning from 6d, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
    . Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must 
      meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
    . Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first.
    . Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.


We'll create a coin-flip game (create 1 HTML file for exercises 6f-6j):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

6f. Generate a random number with Math.random(). 
Save it in a variable.

6g. Create an if-statement and check:
      . If the number is less than 0.5, then display 'heads' in the console
      . Else display 'tails' in the console.

6h. Instead of displaying 'heads' or 'tails' in the console, save the result in a variable called 'result'.

6i. Let's say we're trying to guess the result. Create a variable called 
'guess' and save your guess ('heads' or 'tails').
    . If your guess matches the result, display 'You win!' in the console
    . If your guess does no match the result, display 'You lose!'

6j. (Challenge) Instead of using if-statements in the previous exercises, 
    try switching them into ternary operators (condition ? A:B).

Challenge Exercises 

Setup: We'll improve the Cart Quantity project. First, make a copy of the project from exercise 5k
(if you didn't do 5k, check the solutions).

6k. Let's say the cart has a maximum quantity of 10. Before updatin the quantity, check if the quantity will be greater than 10: 
  . If it will, display a popup saying 'The cart is full' and don't update the quantity.
  . Otherwise, update the quantity and console.log() it as usual. 

6l. In exercise 5i-5k, we created the 'Remove from cart', '-2', and '-3' 
buttons. Before updating the quantity, check if it will go below 0:
  . If it will, create a popup saying 'Not enough items in the cart'
    and don't update the quantity.
  . Otherwise, update the quantity and console.log() it as usual.
